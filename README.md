# Seattle-Weather: Comparing Seattle and New York City's rainfall from 2020-2024
DATA 3320 
Project 1

This repository will house information about the Seattle-Weather project for the DATA 3320 class. This project will help us learn skills such as data cleaning and visualization.

## Data
National Centers for Environmental Information NOAA Climate DataLinks has provided data on the daily preciptation measured in both cities from January 1st, 2020 - January 1st, 2024. The following data sets include seattle_rain.csv and ny_rain.csv provided in the repository.

## Description
The repository comprises of documents, Colab notebooks, and analyses needed to fulfill the project. Using data visualization and providing analysis, we have concluded that it rains more in New York City than in Seattle.

## Data Preparation/Processing
To prepare the data, we were asked to complete various tasks such as (but not limited to) inspecting the contents of the data set, conducting IQR statistics, converting data types to their correct types, identify missing values, remove unnecessary parts, rename columns, join tables together, and more. These various tasks helped us complete a thorough cleaning of the data set. All of these tasks are completed in the DATA_3320_Data_Preparation.ipynb file located in this repository. Subsequently, check out the clean_seattle_nyc_weather.csv (3) also attached in the repository.

## Requirements
The programs and packages used to perform the analysis are: Google Colab, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, missingno, and seaborn. The packages can be imported on Google Colab.
