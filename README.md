DATA 3320 
Project 1

This repository will house information about the Seattle-Weather project for the DATA 3320 class. This project will help us learn skills such as data cleaning and visualization.

Using data science methodoloy, this project will help develop the skills of data cleaning and data visualization. Additionally, the project's purpose is to determine whether it rains more in Seattle, Washington than in New York City, NY. National Centers for Environmental Information NOAA Climate DataLinks has provided data on the daily preciptation measured in both cities from January 1st, 2020 through January 1st, 2024. The following data sets include seattle_rain.csv and ny_rain.csv provided in the repository.

## Data Preparation
To prepare the data, we were asked to complete various tasks such as (but not limited to) inspecting the contents of the data set, conducting IQR statistics, converting data types to their correct types, identify missing values, remove unnecessary parts, rename columns, join tables together, and more. These various tasks helped us complete a thorough cleaning of the data set. All of these tasks are completed in the DataPreparation.ipynb file located in this repository. Subsequently, check out the clean_seattle_nyc_weather.csv also attached in the repository.
